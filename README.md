# Notes
A collection of notes I've taken while learning web development languages and topics. 
(Also used as a way to practice Markdown skills)
Content includes notes on: 
* BEM, accessibility, responsiveness, SEO 
* Languages/libraries/frameworks like javascript, jQuery, React
* Database uses with mySQL
