# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
SEO 
: the practice of increasing quality and quantity of website traffic, brand exposure and __organic__ search engine results 

Search engines
: use a process of "crawling and indexing" to evaluate and catablogue available/new/updated content and orders them based on how well it matches the query 

Understand user purpose:
 * Navigational --> looking for specific web page
 * Informational --> looking for specific topic
 * Transactional --> look to purchase specific product 

|Properties| Practices| 
|---|-----|
|Google specific| indicate specific pages to and not to crawl with sitemaps and robots.txt (also consider using google search console) |
HTML| titles should be unique and short| 
|| meta tags for descriptions should summarize the page |
|| use headings for keywords instead of excessively using <strong> or <em> |
| Navigation| use breadcrumb lists, keep directory well structured around the homepage/root (naturally flowing hierarchy)|
|| show useful 404 pages, avoid deeply nested directories, keep URLs short and easy to understand (less special chars)|
Link Profile| link to other credible and popular sites to maintain healty link profile| 
General| be responsive and accessible

Sitemaps
: XML file that provides search engines with information about pages available for crawling (eg. how important it is relative to other pages, and how often it's modified)
